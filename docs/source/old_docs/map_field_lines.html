    Function for mapping each field-line to the intersection with the vessel walls

    <p><b>Input</b>: x_vec_at_omp,  a numpy array with the radial points at the OMP where
                          we want the mapping to start
           file_path,     a string with the path to the FIESTA equilibrium .mat file
           configuration, a string with either 'limited' or 'diverted', where 'diverted'
                          is the defualt configuration

    <p><b>Return</b>: field_line_dict, a python dictionary with the radial position from the OMP in m
                             as the key and the field-line dictionary with the R, phi
                             and Z components along the field line as well as the length, l,
                             from the LCFS to the current point along the field-line
